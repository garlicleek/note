Violent movies tend to have an unfavorable effect on teenagers. One of the crucial factors is that adolescents are too young to judge what deeds are appropriate, so that they tend to imitate the hazardous behaviors which have been shown in the movies, and eventually commit the crimes. For example, some Japanese high school students indulging in action movies bully other schoolmates and beat them. In this case, students who mimic dangerous actions in violent movies will ultimately lose their bright lives and regret what they did in prison.
