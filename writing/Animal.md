Some people think we can use animals in the medical experiment for benefits of humans, while others think this is a cruel thing, thus needing to be prohibited. Discuss both views and gibe uoe opinion.

主题: 应不应该用动物做实验
背景: 人们的医学需要动物实验推进

拿动物和人类基因/身体结构相似, 对药物反应相似, 在动物身上试药药品的疗效和副作用, 科学家根据实验结果进行改进, 研发出更靠谱的药品帮人治病.
减少世界疾病
1. 帮人治病
2. 科学家拿动物测试过的药帮人治病
3. 中国科学家拿猪测试过的抗癌药帮助癌病人缓解病痛

More and more drugs benefiting human beings are needed for medical improvement.Meanwhile, more and more experiments with animals are conducted as well. Some people may argue that there are a lot of benefits to human using animals in medical experiments while others claim that this research should be prohibited for its cruelty.
The reason for humans doing medical research on animals may involve crucial factors is that we have to examine negative effect of medicine to prevent human from any unanticipated danger.Due to the fact that Animal's physical structure resemble the humans' and its body are actually low price, animal experiment is the most efficient and cheapest method at present. Chinese specialist have managed to invent a sorts of anti-caner medicines which could alleviate patients' cancer prominently.
