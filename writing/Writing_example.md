In my opinion, there are various reasons contributing to this, but some visible measures can be adopted to combat the situation.

Firstly, one of the key reasons for this may involve crucial factor is that students are distracted by smart phone. Nowadays, technology and economy level is soaring. In this case, every student at present are capable of owning a smart phone supported by their parents. Besides, numerous applications fromm teenagers who are immature and cannot distinguish right from wrong. Consequently, student indulge in mobile and concentrate on phone rather than tutor. The second reason may lie in the fact that lots of schools would hire graduates owing to inadequate educational resources. This action lead teachers who have les experience and low-quality teaching skills to guide kids in the classroom. Thus insufficiently vivid description and boring curriculum make children gradually lose interest in learning.

Owing to this, some feasible measure can be adopted to combat the situation. First of all, school should state a strict discipline to forbid from students bringing cellphone to school. Secondly, school could organize some checks to ensure whether they obey the rules. For example, school may advise parents and teachers to inspect children's bag and confirm there is no mobile phone in the bag before school and class. Then the student who break the rules will be punished by running several laps around the playground or cleaning the classroom. In this case, no one would like to take smart phone to school anymore. As for teacher, students should mark the teachers and Those with low ratings will have their bonuses cut. In addition school can arrange regular discussion between tutors and students thus the curriculum would be justified as that students are fond of.
